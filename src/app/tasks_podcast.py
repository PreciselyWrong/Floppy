"""One-shot backfill of podcast show/episode website links.

``website_url`` was added to ``PodcastShow``/``PodcastEpisode`` for issue #1014,
but every code path only wrote it when a row was first created, so libraries
that predate the field kept blank links forever. The refresh paths now update
existing rows too, which repairs a show the moment anything re-reads its feed --
but that only happens when a user opens the show, syncs it, or re-runs a
provider import. This sweep walks every show with a feed once so the repair does
not wait on any of that.

It is deliberately one-shot rather than an ongoing reconcile: unlike the genre
and watch-provider sweeps, whose candidate sets shrink as items succeed, a feed
that simply has no <link> element (Apple's and Spotify's do not) never stops
qualifying, so a "still missing a website" filter would re-fetch those feeds
forever. Completion is recorded durably by ``app.reconcile_state``; re-running
the sweep later is a ``PODCAST_WEBSITE_BACKFILL_VERSION`` bump, which
``reconcile_state.get_state`` already treats as a reset.
