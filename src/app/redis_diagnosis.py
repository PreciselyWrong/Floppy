"""Say why Redis could not be reached, in words an operator can act on.

A failed Redis connection reaches Floppy wrapped several times over. Kombu's
``OperationalError`` wraps redis-py's ``ConnectionError``, which in turn wraps the
socket error that actually happened. Each caller used to report the outermost
layer, so an unresolvable hostname surfaced as "check the worker" or "check that
the Redis service is running". Neither points at the real cause (#1166, #1229,
#1263).

The common real cause is a stack whose containers do not share a user-defined
Docker network. Docker then cannot resolve the service name ``redis``. This
module finds the underlying failure and describes it the same way in the startup
log, in ``floppy_preflight`` and in the message an import shows.
