# Alpine only hides an `x-show` element once it has booted. A modal backdrop is
# a full-screen `fixed inset-0 bg-black/50` div, so until then it renders over
# the whole page. `x-cloak` plus the global `[x-cloak] { display: none
# !important }` rule in input.css is what suppresses that flash, and it has to
# be on the same element as the `x-show`.
#
# Rendering every page that carries one of these is far more scaffolding than a
# single attribute warrants, and misses any template no test happens to render
# (media_card_list.html, episode_row.html and detail_action_buttons.html all
# went without it). Scanning the templates covers them all, including ones
# added later.
