"""Periodic raw SQLite snapshot for disaster recovery (#1053).

CSV export (integrations.exports.write_backup) cannot replace a physically
damaged db.sqlite3: it needs a working Django install to import into, and it
carries only media/ratings/lists, not accounts or integration credentials.
This task writes a verified, atomically-published copy of the live database
itself, so a corrupted file has something real to be replaced with.
