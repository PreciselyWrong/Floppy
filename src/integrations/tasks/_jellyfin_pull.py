"""Celery tasks for automatic Jellyfin watch-history import.

No manual TSV export/upload required. Two tiers, tried in order for each run:

1. Playback Reporting plugin REST API (``submit_custom_query``) -- full
   per-play history with stable rowids, but only reachable with an admin
   API key and the plugin installed.
2. Core Jellyfin API UserData backfill -- one watch event per played item,
   works with any connected account, used as the fallback when tier 1
   isn't reachable.
