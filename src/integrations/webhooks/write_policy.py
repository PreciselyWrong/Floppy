"""When a playback webhook may write tracking rows.

Every media-server webhook asks this module before it creates or changes a
Movie/Episode row. Play, resume and pause only update the Now Playing card;
a stop, scrobble or manual mark is what writes. Clients that only ever send
"play" (e.g. Bunny Ears TV in activity-only mode, 82e424f2) could otherwise
leave items stuck In Progress, and every progress tick would get another
chance to write to a mis-resolved show (#1250).

Each integration has one row in ``WEBHOOK_WRITE_POLICIES``, keyed by its
processor's ``SOURCE_LABEL``. Exceptions live here too, with their reason.
See docs/architecture/webhook-write-rules.md.
