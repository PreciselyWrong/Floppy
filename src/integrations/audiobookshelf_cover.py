"""Signed-token helpers for the Audiobookshelf cover art proxy.

Audiobookshelf's ``/api/items/:id/cover`` endpoint requires a bearer token,
so the raw URL can never be embedded directly in an ``<img src>`` - the
browser has no way to attach the header. Floppy instead serves these covers
through its own authenticated proxy (see ``integrations.views.audiobookshelf_cover``),
identified by a signed token so the view never has to trust client input for
which account/item to fetch. This mirrors ``app.image_cache``'s provider
image proxy, but is scoped to a user's own Audiobookshelf account rather
than a fixed CDN allowlist, since ABS servers are arbitrary user-configured
hosts.
