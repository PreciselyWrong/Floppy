"""A parallel test runner that cannot be stranded by a lost worker result.

Django's ``ParallelTestSuite`` hands each subsuite to a
``multiprocessing.Pool`` and drains the results with ``imap_unordered``. If a
result is produced but never delivered, that iterator never raises
``StopIteration``, and the parent waits for it forever.

This is not hypothetical here. Instrumenting the runner locally
(``docs/architecture/test-suite-cost.md``) showed:

    PARENT_DISPATCH total_subsuites=659 processes=4
    WORKER_START:      659
    WORKER_DONE:       659      <- every subsuite finished
    PARENT_RECEIVED:   565      <- 94 results never arrived

and a watchdog dump from a real CI run caught the parent at
``pool.py:861 in next`` / ``django/test/runner.py:541 in run`` -- the result
loop -- with ``_handle_workers`` and ``_handle_tasks`` alive and no
``_handle_results`` thread at all. ``multiprocessing`` confirms it from the
other side: tearing such a pool down raises ``AssertionError: Cannot have cache
with result_handler not alive``, which is precisely "results outstanding, and
the thread that would deliver them is gone".

It survives ``spawn``, the results pickle fine (188 KB for a whole run), and it
is intermittent and load-dependent. Nobody has root-caused it. What makes it
expensive is that the CI job has no ``timeout-minutes``, so a hung run holds a
runner for GitHub's six-hour default and reports nothing.

So this subclass does not try to fix the race. It makes the *collection* side
unable to hang on it:

1. **Completion** is detected by counting results, not by waiting for
   ``StopIteration``.
2. **Stalling** is bounded: if nothing arrives for ``stall_timeout`` seconds,
   stop waiting and re-dispatch whatever never came back to a *fresh pool*.
   A fresh pool is a faithful worker environment; the parent is not, so
   running the work here is kept as a last resort after several attempts.
3. **Teardown** avoids ``multiprocessing``'s own API entirely. Neither
   ``pool.join()`` nor ``pool.terminate()`` is safe on a pool in this state --
   both can block forever, and two earlier versions of this file relocated the
   hang into each of them in turn. Workers are given a deadline and then
   killed directly.

Nothing is skipped, disabled or quarantined: a recovered run executes every
test, it is just slower than it should have been. It says so loudly, because
needing the fallback means the underlying race is still there.

    * it asserts that a pool with outstanding results still has a live
      ``_result_handler`` thread, which is exactly what has gone missing;
    * worse, ``_terminate_pool`` calls ``_help_stuff_finish``, which takes the
      task queue's ``_rlock`` -- and the task handler thread is still holding
      it. That is a deadlock, and it was observed: a run stalled, detected the

    """``DiscoverRunner`` that defaults to serial, and survives parallel.

    Two different failures hide behind "the suite hangs", and they need
    different answers:

    * On a *subset* of the suite, results go missing at random and a fresh pool
      delivers them: ``ResilientParallelTestSuite`` recovers that cleanly, five
      runs out of five.
    * On the *whole* suite, the same subsuites go missing every time --
      measured at 131 of 923, with three fresh pools recovering only 2 of them.
      Work that is lost deterministically is not a delivery race; the workers
      carrying it are dying, which also fits the SIGSEGV seen on CI. No amount
      of re-dispatching fixes that.

    So parallelism is off by default. With ``parallel=1`` Django builds a plain
    suite and never touches ``multiprocessing`` (see ``DiscoverRunner.build_suite``,
    which guards the whole parallel path on ``parallel > 1``), so there is no
    pool, no worker to lose, and nothing to hang on. The suite runs slower and
    finishes.

    ``FLOPPY_TEST_PARALLEL=<n>`` opts back in for anyone who wants the speed
    locally; the resilient suite above is what makes that survivable.
